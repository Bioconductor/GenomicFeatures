\title{
  Extract genomic features from an object based on their by genomic location

  Generic functions to extract genomic features for specified genomic
  locations.

  \item{type}{How to perform the interval overlap operations of the
    \code{ranges}. See the
    \code{\link[GenomicRanges:findOverlaps-methods]{findOverlaps}} manual page
    in the GRanges package for more information.}

\details{
  These functions subset the results of \code{\link{transcripts}},
  \code{\link{exons}}, and \code{\link{cds}} function calls with
  using the results of \code{\link[IRanges:IntervalTree-class]{findOverlaps}}
  calls based on the specified \code{ranges}.
