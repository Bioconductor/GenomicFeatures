o makeTxDbFromUCSC() - Address the CDS non-completeness issue.
  The status of the CDS (complete or not) can be inferred from the
  cds*Stat field (when present) of the UCSC table.

o Too many helper functions are defined and used internally to query the
  db:
  - direct use of DBI::dbGetQuery(), RSQLite::dbGetPreparedQuery(),
    and RSQLite::dbSendPreparedQuery()
  - dbEasyQuery() is defined in AnnotationDbi and GenomicFeatures with
    different definitions.
  - AnnotationDbi:::dbQuery() is the same as GenomicFeatures:::dbEasyQuery()
  - queryAnnotationDb()
  - GenomicFeatures:::dbEasyPreparedQuery()
  Clean this mess!
