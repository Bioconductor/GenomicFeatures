- makeTranscriptDbFromUCSC() - Address the CDS non-completeness issue.
  The status of the CDS (complete or not) can be inferred from the
  cds*Stat field (when present) of the UCSC table.

- makeTranscriptDbFromBiomart() - Catch invalid transcript ids and
  raise an error (or maybe just a warning?). Also nicely handle
  'transcript_ids=character(0)'.

- makeTranscriptDbFromGFF3() - Primary target: GFF3 files on the TAIR,
  Flybase and Wormbase websites/FTP servers.
