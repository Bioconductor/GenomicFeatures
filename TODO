- makeTranscriptDbFromUCSC() - Address the CDS non-completeness issue.
  The status of the CDS (complete or not) can be inferred from the
  cds*Stat field (when present) of the UCSC table.

- makeTranscriptDbFromBiomart() - Only biomart="ensembl" is supported for
  now. Other databases could be supported e.g. bacterial_mart_3, fungal_mart_3,
  metazoa_mart_3, plant_mart_3, protist_mart_3. They have all the attributes
  required by makeTranscriptDbFromBiomart() except for the cds/utr attributes
  that are missing. The function could easily be adapted to support this and
  issue a warning that no CDS will be stored in the TranscriptDb object.

- makeTranscriptDbFromGFF3() - Primary target: GFF3 files on the TAIR,
  Flybase and Wormbase websites/FTP servers.
